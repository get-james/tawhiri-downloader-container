# tawhiri-downloader-container

_tawhiri-downloader-container_ is a containised version of [_tawhiri-downloader_](https://github.com/cuspaceflight/tawhiri-downloader).

## Notes
- data from up to Feb 12 2021 is available on aws
- The latest version of this container is available from `ghcr.io/projecthorus/tawhiri-downloader-container:latest`.
- Downloaded data sets are stored in `/srv/tawhiri-datasets`. These need to be made avilable to [_tawhiri-container_](https://github.com/projecthorus/tawhiri-container), and it is recommend that `/srv` is shared between these containers using a method such as a bind mount or volume.
- A timezone must be passed to the container, either by setting the `TZ` environment variable, or by bind mounting `/etc/localtime` in to the container from the host system.
- This defaults to only downloading the latest model from S3 by using `scripts/download.py`to search for the latest model. This is because the SondeHub infrastructure doesn't run the downloader in daemon mode but rather performs a full container replacement when model updates occur.

## Examples

To run in _daemon_ mode:

```sh
docker run --rm --entrypoint /root/tawhiri-downloader/default/main.exe -i -t -e TZ=UTC -v /opt/tawhiri:/srv ghcr.io/projecthorus/tawhiri-downloader-container:latest daemon
```

To download a specific dataset:
```sh
docker run --platform=linux/x86_64 --entrypoint "/root/tawhiri-downloader/default/main.exe" -e TZ=UTC -v ~/tawhiri:/srv/tawhiri-datasets ghcr.io/projecthorus/tawhiri-downloader-container:latest  one -base-url aws-mirror -log-level DEBUG 2023012318
```
